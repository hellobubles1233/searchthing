## [Rebang.Online](https://rebang.online)

An enhanced, feature-rich fork of [unduck](https://github.com/t3dotgg/unduck) that makes DuckDuckGo's bang redirects lightning fast while adding powerful new features and a modern interface.

* Dark mode default
* Visual feedback during searches

## Intelligent Search with Bang Discovery

The search bar on the **!ReBang** home page does more than just accept queries:

* **Bang autocomplete** - Discover new bangs as you type with intelligent suggestions
* **Visual indicators** - See which bangs are available for your current query
* **Instant feedback** - Know exactly where you'll be redirected before pressing Enter
* **Custom bang integration** - Your custom bangs appear alongside official bangs in search results


## Expanded Bang Collection

**!ReBang** goes beyond DuckDuckGo's bang collection:

* **Create your own bangs** - Add shortcuts to any website you frequently use
* **AI-focused bangs** - Quickly access ChatGPT (`!chat`), Claude (`!claude`), Perplexity (`!perp`), and other AI assistants
* **Curated collection** - Our bang list is regularly audited to remove dead links that DuckDuckGo hasn't maintained
* **Community suggestions** - New bangs are added based on user requests and usage patterns

## Clean, Optimized, FAST Bang Database

While DuckDuckGo boasts about their 13,000+ bangs, we've learned that nearly half of them don't work! **!ReBang** focuses on quality, ensuring every bang in our database:
  * Points to a working website
  * Uses the correct search URL format
  * Is properly maintained and updated

**!ReBang** dramatically improves on DuckDuckGo's bang database with a thorough cleanup and optimization:

* **Removed 6,500+ dead bangs** - Eliminated bangs pointing to:
  * Websites that no longer exist (over 4,900 dead domains!)
  * Search functions that have been deprecated or changed
  * Redirects that lead nowhere or to unexpected destinations
  
* **Eliminated massive redundancy** - DuckDuckGo artificially inflated their bang count with duplicates:
  * **German Amazon alone had 10+ different bangs** (`!amazonde`, `!amazonger`, `!amazondeutschland`, `!amazong`, etc.) all pointing to the exact same URL
  * Countless sites had 5-6 different bangs that all did the same thing
  * Many sites had separate bangs for their .com, .org, .net domains — all redirecting to the same place
  * This redundancy makes the system harder to use and unnecessarily bloated
  
* **Intelligent organization** - Reduced database size by ~49% without losing functionality:
  * Proper aliasing of identical destinations
  * Binary search optimization for instant results
  * Consolidated URLs with the same destination, while keeping the aliasing

* **Why hasn't DuckDuckGo done this?** - Despite promoting bangs as a key feature for over a decade, DuckDuckGo has neglected basic maintenance of their bang database. **!ReBang** steps in to provide what users deserve: a clean, fast, and reliable bang system.

   - Add the URL `https://rebang.online/?q=%s` to your browser's custom search engines
   - Set **!ReBang** as your default search engine.
   - Type your search, include a bang `!g` `!yt` `!w` somewhere in the search, and **!ReBang** will reroute your request to where you want to search.
   - **Create custom bangs** by clicking the "My Bangs" button on the homepage!

2. **Direct Use:** 
   - Visit the website directly https://rebang.online/

## How to Create Custom Bangs

Creating your own bangs is simple:

3. Enter your bang's:
   - **Trigger** (e.g., `maps` for `!maps`)
